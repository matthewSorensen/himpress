Various spatial moves:
>>> move <direction>
where direction is either "up","down","left","right", or a triplet of signed integers representing
change in x,y and z respectively ("1000 -1000 1000")
>>> zooom <magnitude>
where magnitude is either "in","out", or an integer (positive corresponds to out, and in and out both
have an absolute value of 1). If a magnitude is
not provided, defaults to "in".
>>> rotate <integer>
>>> rotate <integer> <integer>
>>> rotate <integer> <integer> <integer>
Rotation - one integer corresponds to 2d rotation, and two or more 3d, representing x,y,z respectively).
